We place special sensors, that check moisture levels.we can know the
temperature, whether the water motor is running, ensuring to always stay in loop.
The system adjusts watering schedules based on unique needs of crop of field.About
Technologies Used-AI algorithms can analyse data from IOT sensors to predict issues like
soil moisture levels, it allows timely maintenance. Automatic regulation of valves for release
of water using AI.The Iot sensors in soil, irrigation pipes collect the data and is processed
to make irrigation decisions by allowing the user to access the data on immediate
adjustments based on conditions.
Optimised resource usage, minimised environmental impact to improve
productivity.Graphical User Interface-To monitor and intervene the system as needed while
also trusting in AIâ€™s decisions.the user can access the GUI in terms of increased crop yield,
water savings and operational efficiency.Implementations:This can be implemented with
two stages.
Injecting sensors data, time data and various other factors,
bluetooth and wifi modules for wireless connection into arduino to automate it.
There are different real time scenarios for which the system can let you to sit back and
relax knowing that our system has got it all under control.
